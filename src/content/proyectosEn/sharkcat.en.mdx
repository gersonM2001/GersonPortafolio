# SharckCat 

SharkCat was launched as a digital platform, geared towards the educational sector, designed to connect students with tutors specializing in various areas of knowledge, such as mathematics, programming, and the arts, among others.

The solution allows individuals with verifiable expertise to offer tutoring services, while students can access personalized academic support, fostering collaborative learning and the development of technical and academic skills.

## Target audience
- Non-professionals with demonstrable knowledge of the subjects they wish to teach.
- Students with demonstrable knowledge of the subjects they wish to teach who want to earn extra income.
- Students with questions or concerns about topics in various fields of knowledge.

# Development and implementation

During the project's development, I actively participated as a full-stack developer, working on both the frontend and backend of the platform.

Next.js was used for the presentation layer, enabling an optimized user experience, efficient rendering, and a modern structure for web applications.
NestJS was implemented in the backend, selected after a technical analysis that evaluated scalability, maintainability, and best architectural practices.

The choice of these technologies was based on their ability to adapt to the system's functional and non-functional requirements, as well as their compatibility with modern architectures, market trends, and cloud deployments.

Finally, the application was deployed using Railway, facilitating continuous integration, environment management, and efficient production deployment.
