# Objective
Swiftdrop is a delivery app, similar to PedidosYa!, Hugo, etc., with the difference that this app sought to improve the customer-seller-delivery relationship, aiming to provide better service to the latter than they currently receive.
From the sellers' perspective, the app also aimed to be more open, meaning that small grocery stores, hardware stores, and other businesses that cannot afford a dedicated driver could access the service, thus improving their market competitiveness.
