# Proposal
A project developed with the PokeApi was presented, which allowed users to obtain Pokémon of different types.
However, it only returned the name and type, so the aim was to enrich this proposal by obtaining different information, such as stats and attacks.
Therefore, the following was done:

# Developed Elements
## Infrastructure in Azure + Terraform
The first step was to implement the necessary elements in Azure, using the Terraform tool
for creating BlobStorage, Queue, AppService, Function Application, SQL Server, and Container Registry.

### API with FastAPI
The existing endpoints were expanded; in this case, an endpoint was added to download CSV files stored in BlobStorage,
as well as an endpoint to delete records, taking into account two elements: the record in the database and the file created and stored in BlobStorage.

### Function App
There was a serverless service to manage the information stored in a queue, as well as handling the different states: "Sent, Processing, and Completed."
It also created the CSV file with the basic data. This was modified to enrich the CSV with the necessary elements, in addition to a new field called "max_random_pokemons." This field was a value provided by the user for the number of Pokémon records they wanted. It was modified to display random Pokémon of the selected type.

### App Service with Next.js
It had a table structure, with the option to select a Pokémon type, a "catch 'em all" button to make the request to the API, and a button to download the CSV file.
This frontend was enhanced by adding an input to specify the number of records, as well as a modification to download the CSV file to call the new requested endpoint.
And a button to delete the record; this button includes a modal for the user to confirm whether they want to delete the record or not.

### SQL
At the database level, the changes were to add a new field "max_random_pokemons" to store the random value the user wanted, as well as changing the stored procedure to execute and save this same element.
