# Proposal
In daily life, people often have various expenses that may seem small at the time, but in the long run, 
these expenses, when added together, can represent a significant expenditure of daily resources. 
Therefore, this "Mobile Expenses" application is proposed. We assume that people always carry their cell phones, 
allowing them to easily log their spending and see how their money is being spent over the long term.

# Developed elements.
1. Main View: Here, the user can see how much money they have spent that day, giving them a better understanding of their current financial situation.
2. Add New Expense: This button is always located on the main view. Clicking it opens a dropdown menu with the expense fields, such as description, amount, and category, as well as the date. By default, the date is set to the current day, but the user can change it if needed.
3. History: This history is displayed on the main view, allowing the user to quickly and easily see what they have spent money on or if there are any items they forgot to add.
4. Analysis: This view shows a "Total Expenses for the Selected Day." In this area, the user can choose which date they want to view. 5. Filter by category: This has different categories, which the user previously added, but filtered by a previously selected date, as well as the details of those categories.

# Deployment platform 
By using a cross-platform framework like "Flutter," the software can be adapted to specific needs.
In this case, it was decided to release it as an APK for Android, so the **keys** were created as a requirement for creating the application.
Then, the necessary configurations were assigned in the manifest, and the APK was created.

## Technologies.
1. Flutter
2. Dart.
3. C#
4. sqlite
