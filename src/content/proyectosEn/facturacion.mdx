# Requirements analysis
In the initial phase of the project, a *functional and non-functional requirements*
 gathering process was carried out through direct interviews with the store owner.

Based on this analysis, the business rules, inventory workflows, and hierarchical access levels were documented,
 ensuring proper segregation of duties within the system.

Additionally, a *technical and economic feasibility analysis* was performed,
evaluating the available hardware, the estimated implementation costs,
 and the environmental constraints, which allowed for the definition of a solution
  aligned with the client's actual capabilities.

# Design
The system was developed using a modular architecture, allowing:
- Clear separation between business logic and user interface.
- Scalability for future functionalities.
- Efficient maintenance and debugging.

# Development
Given the client's technical limitations, a local system was developed using Windows Forms on the *.NET Framework 4.7.2*,
 thus ensuring compatibility, stability, and ease of maintenance.

# Key features.

- User management.
- Role-based access control.
- Data validation and error handling.
- Data persistence using a relational database engine.
- Inventory control using various approaches.
- Sales control.
- Invoicing for external clients.
