# What was done?
This project consisted of the design and implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process
started from scratch, using a relational database in Oracle that contained
historical sales information for a company dedicated to the sale of auto parts.

The main objective was to extract the data from the original relational model,
transform it through cleansing, normalization, and simplification processes, and load it into
a new database designed using a Snowflake Schema dimensional model,
implemented in SQL Server Express.

This new model allowed for:

1. A better understanding of the sales history
2. Optimization of analytical queries
3. Preparation of the information for use in Business Intelligence tools

Finally, the dimensional database was integrated with Tableau, enabling the
generation of dynamic and interactive dashboards focused on analyzing the business's historical
performance and supporting decision-making.

## How was it done?
The ETL process was developed using a web application, which served as the control and execution interface for the data flow.

Fronend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for visualization and process execution.

Backend: Node.js and Express handled database connections, data extraction, transformation, and loading.

The following processes were implemented:

- Data extraction from Oracle
- Data transformation and cleaning
- Structured loading into SQL Server Express
