# What was done?
This project started from scratch, using a relational database, developed in Oracle, which contained information about sales for an auto parts company.

The project required migrating from a relational model, which is how the information was originally stored,
 and extracting it from that database. This data was then transformed into simpler, more refined, and easily 
 understandable information to be placed in a new database, this time using the *snowflake* model,
 this will be inserted *SQL Express* database management system. This was then connected to the *Tableu* tool to dynamically generate visually 
appealing charts, that were easy to understand and explain how the historical data was performing.

## How was it done?
It was developed through a web application, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend; Node.js and Express were used for the backend.
