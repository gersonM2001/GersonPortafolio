# About the company

Inversiones Caceres is a company that sells items online, but they had a problem
regarding how they managed their information, since there was no inventory system beyond some accounting books,
which is why they requested an analysis of which systems could be viable given the company's situation.

## Proposed Solution
A database was developed using PostgreSQL. Support was provided in brand design and in developing business elements such as the mission and vision statements.
For the information system, the best alternative found for the company was Odoo, an open-source information system that also promotes company growth, which, given current needs, was the best solution.

## Technologies used
- Odoo
- PostgresSql
- Figma
