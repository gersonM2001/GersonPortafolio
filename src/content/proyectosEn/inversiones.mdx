# About the company

Inversiones Cáceres is a company dedicated to selling goods online.

At the start of the project, the organization presented deficiencies in information management and inventory control, as records were kept manually using accounting ledgers,
which generated a risk of errors, a lack of traceability, and limitations to business growth.

Given this situation, an analysis of the current situation (AS-IS) was requested, along with an evaluation of viable technological solutions, considering the company's size,
its projected growth, and its operational and technical capabilities.

## Proposed Solution
As a result of the analysis, a database was designed and implemented using PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and scalability.

Additionally, support was provided in strategic and corporate identity aspects, including:
1. Defining mission and vision
2. Aligning the brand with business objectives.

For the information system, it was determined that the best alternative was the implementation of Odoo, an open-source ERP, which allowed for:

- Centralizing inventory management
- Improving control of business operations
- Facilitating business scalability
- Reducing licensing costs

## Technologies used
