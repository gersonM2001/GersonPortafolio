# Objective
At the time the analysis and design of a new system was requested, the Honduran College of Accountants
was in the process of developing this platform, but the analysis of all the requirements had not been done beforehand,
as well as a lack of a clear vision of how they wanted their platform to look, or even how access to it would work.

## Proposal
The first step was to speak with the person in charge of developing this learning platform. In the initial meetings, the objectives were outlined, as well as the target audience. With this starting point established, the following steps were taken:
1. Technical Feasibility
2. Economic Feasibility
3. Operational Feasibility
4. Definition of User Stories
5. Database Development (PostgreSQL)
6. Mockups

## Technologies used
- Suit Office
- Figma
- PostgresSql
